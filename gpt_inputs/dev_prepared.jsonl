{"prompt":" Dentsu Inc., the world's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the Japanese market, is setting its sights on overseas expansion.<P> Last year, Dentsu started HDM, a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France. A few months ago, Dentsu acquired 69% of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars -LRB-US$4.6 million-RRB-. Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries, but they keep low profiles.<P> Now, the giant marketing company, which holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen -LRB-$30.96 billion-RRB- advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe. What is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe. \"If we don't do something . . . we won't be able to catch up with demand,\" says a Dentsu spokesman. \"Our president said acquisition is an effective method.\"<P> Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future. So far, it appears cautious about taking the big step. For example, the spokesman says Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC. But he said Dentsu hasn't looked seriously at Saatchi.<P> Though Dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines, it is laying the groundwork for international growth. It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad.<P> For the year ended March 31, Dentsu sales rose 19% to $8.9 billion from $7.5 billion, and net income jumped 59% to $102 million from $64 million. Dentsu's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam, the world's second-largest ad agency, according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age.<P> But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers. On its own, Dentsu's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-Japanese clients. Thus, an acquisition may prove the necessary course.<P> But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different. Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice \"that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules,\" says Roy Warman, the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi's communications division.<P> Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the Dentsu spokesman. But the different business system would make it hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services they do in Japan. ->","completion":" Dentsu Inc., the world's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the Japanese market, is setting its sights on overseas expansion.<P> ) ( ( ( ( Last year, Dentsu started HDM, a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France. ) ( ( A few months ago, Dentsu acquired 69% of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars ) ( -LRB-US$4.6 million-RRB-. ) ) ( ( Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries, ) ( but they keep low profiles.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( Now, the giant marketing company, ) ( ( ( which holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen ) ( -LRB-$30.96 billion-RRB- ) ) ( advertising industry, ) ) ) ( is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe. ) ) ) ( ( ( What is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need ) ( ( to keep up with its Japanese clients ) ( as they grow in the U.S. and Europe. ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( \"If we don't do something . . . ) ( we won't be able to catch up with demand,\" ) ) ( says a Dentsu spokesman. ) ) ( ( \"Our president said ) ( acquisition is an effective method.\"<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, ) ( but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future. ) ) ( So far, it appears cautious about taking the big step. ) ) ( ( ( ( For example, the spokesman says ) ( Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC. ) ) ( ( But he said ) ( Dentsu hasn't looked seriously at Saatchi.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( Though Dentsu says ) ( ( it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines, ) ( ( it is laying the groundwork for international growth. ) ( ( It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets ) ( and training workers to do business abroad.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( For the year ) ( ended March 31, ) ) ( ( Dentsu sales rose 19% to $8.9 billion from $7.5 billion, ) ( and net income jumped 59% to $102 million from $64 million. ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Dentsu's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam, the world's second-largest ad agency, ) ( according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age.<P> ) ) ( ( ( But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers. ) ( ( On its own, Dentsu's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets ) ( when seeking non-Japanese clients. ) ) ) ( Thus, an acquisition may prove the necessary course.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad ) ( because client relationships are different. ) ) ( ( ( Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice ) ( \"that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules,\" ) ) ( says Roy Warman, the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi's communications division.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, ) ( ( many clients would also be Japanese companies ) ( expanding overseas, ) ) ) ( says the Dentsu spokesman. ) ) ( ( But the different business system would make it hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services ) ( they do in Japan. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" Time magazine, in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers, is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year, increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways.<P> In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will \"dramatically de-emphasize\" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 to $55.<P> In a related development, the news-weekly, for the fourth year in a row, said it won't increase its advertising rates in 1990; a full, four-color page in the magazine costs about $120,000. However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered, ad rates will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber, according to Richard Heinemann, Time associate publisher.<P> Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers. In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co. 's McCall's, and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers.<P> Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies. But Time, as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner, wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks. Besides, Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky. \"Giveaways just give people the wrong image,\" said Mr. Heinemann. \"That perception takes the focus off the magazine.\"<P> Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers. \"What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it,\" said Mr. Heinemann. \"We are trying to create quality and involvement.\"<P> However, Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million. And Time's paid circulation, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations, dropped 7.3% to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30, 1989.<P> Still, Time's move is being received well, once again. \"It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more,\" said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency. \"A few drops in circulation are of no consequence. It's not a show of weakness; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits.\"<P> Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away. \"The question is how much are we getting from each reader,\" said Mr. Heinemann.<P> Time's rivals news-weeklies, Washington Post Co.

Since then, deliveries have slumped. GM's car sales dropped 24.8% in mid-October to 69,980, while truck sales fell 26% to 37,860. GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month, while other auto makers reported mixed results.<P> All of the Big Three suffered in the just-ended period, however, with sales of all domestically made cars, including those built at Japanese-managed plants, falling 19% to 158,863 from a year earlier. The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles, a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October, but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago.<P> Sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-October, dropping 22.8% to 94,543 from a year ago.<P> The Big Three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans 10.4% below year-ago levels, but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales don't improve. Industry analyst John H. Qualls, a vice president with Hill & Knowlton in St. Louis, forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93-day supply of cars at the end of the year, even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter. Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2% drop in sales of domestic-made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2% drop in domestic trucks to 31,143. The sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles, said Joel Pitcoff, a Ford analyst. The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of \"scavengers\" for bargain-basement 1989 cars, he said.<P> Town & Country Ford in Charlotte, N.C., still needs to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks.

But sales of domestic cars and trucks at Nissan Motor Corp. rose 26.1% to 5,651.

{"prompt":" Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc., a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players.<P> Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts, by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime, cable-TV industry executives say. Time officials declined to comment.<P> Last week, Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $225 million for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary, which is a distant second to Time's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers. Tele-Communications, the U.S.'s largest cable company, said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment.<P> Tele-Communications is HBO's largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships. Earlier this year, Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO, executives at both companies said. The purchase of the Showtime stake is \"a direct slap in our face,\" said one senior Time executive.<P> Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York, where Viacom in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime. Executives involved in plotting Time's defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants. The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated, or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime.<P> Viacom officials declined to comment. Jerome Kern, Tele-Communications' chief outside counsel, said he wasn't aware of Time's legal plans. But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be \"the pot calling the kettle black.\"<P> \"It's hard to see how an investment by the largest {cable operator} in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive, when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest\" cable operator, Mr. Kern said.<P> In addition to owning HBO, with 22 million subscribers, Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers. Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and Viacom has about one million. In its suit against Time, Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power. Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications, Viacom has potentially more power, particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV, VH-1 and Nick at Nite. Ironically, Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business. Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele-Communications has a 21.8% stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake. But since Time's merger with Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained. Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated.<P> Meanwhile, some legal observers say the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom's antitrust suit against Time. Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on Time's Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems. But yesterday, Manhattan Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers.<P> Showtime has also accused HBO of locking up the lion's share of Hollywood's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios. But Showtime has continued to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios, and yesterday announced it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO. ->","completion":" ( ( ( Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc.

{"prompt":" If bluebloods won't pay high prices for racehorses anymore, who will?<P> Breeders are betting on the common folk.<P> The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, a Lexington, Ky.-based trade group, has launched \"seminars\" for \"potential investors\" at race tracks around the country. The group, which has held half a dozen seminars so far, also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers.<P> \"People in this business have been insulated,\" says Josh Pons, a horse breeder from Bel Air, Md. \"But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses.\"<P> At the Laurel race track, the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings, a beer packaging plant worker. Right now, Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program, cheering for Karnak on the Nile, a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch.<P> Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13, and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm. \"Just imagine how exciting that would be if that's your horse,\" he says.<P> But experts caution that this isn't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet. \"It's a big-risk business,\" warns Charles C. Mihalek, a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner. \"You have to go into it firmly believing that it's the kind of investment where you can lose everything.\"<P> And many have done just that. Consider Spendthrift Farm, a prominent Lexington horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year. A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift, hoping to rebuild it.<P> Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights. One big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market. From 1974 to 1984, prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918% to an average of $544,681. Since then, prices have slumped, to an average of $395,374 this summer. But that's for the best horses, with most selling for much less -- as little as $100 for some pedestrian thoroughbreds. Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle, racehorse owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport. Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner's circle and high-society schmoozing. One handout promises: \"Pedigrees, parties, post times, parimutuels and pageantry.\"<P> \"It's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves,\" says Headley Bell, a fifth-generation horse breeder from Lexington.<P> Maybe it's not that simple. For starters, racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures: These beasts don't come with warranties. And for every champion, there are plenty of nags. Katherine Voss, a veteran trainer at the Laurel, Md., track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses.<P> One brown two-year-old filly was wheezing from a cold, while another had splints on its legs, keeping both animals from the racetrack. \"You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof,\" she tells the group. \"There aren't too many winners.\"<P> Perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business. Some badly managed partnerships have burned investors, sometimes after they received advice from industry \"consultants.\" So owners have developed a \"code of ethics,\" outlining rules for consultants and agents, and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest.<P> But some are skeptical of the code's effectiveness. \"The industry is based on individual honesty,\" says Cap Hershey, a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought Spendthrift.<P> Despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds, owning one still isn't cheap.
