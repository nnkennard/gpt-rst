{"prompt":" Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step, 830 million Canadian-dollar -LRB-US$705.6 million-RRB- expansion of its system because Canada's output of crude oil is shrinking.<P> Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate. Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989's first half, about 1% below the 1988 level.<P> \"The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping,\" and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc. Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.<P> \"There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side,\" he said.<P> Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly. The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is \"down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration,\" said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.<P> Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada. Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.<P> Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial's system, whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.<P> Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said John Lichtblau, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico.<P> Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East. \"It's very much a growing concern. But when something is inevitable, you learn to live with it,\" he said.<P> Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output.<P> Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion, which would have required regulatory approval, Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system, beginning with a modest expansion by 1991.

Cole, group vice president at Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest machine tool producer. \"The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term.\"<P> September orders for all U.S. producers, in fact, were slightly above the monthly average for 1988, a good year for the industry.<P> \"Aerospace orders are very good,\" Mr. Cole says. \"And export business is still good. While some automotive programs have been delayed, they haven't been canceled.\"<P> \"September was one of the biggest order months in our history,\" says James R. Roberts, vice president, world-wide sales and marketing, for Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis. At a recent meeting of manufacturing executives, \"everybody I talked with was very positive,\" he says. Most say they plan to spend more on factory equipment in 1990 than in 1989.<P> But sales of North American-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million, down from 7.1 million a year earlier. And truck sales also are off more than 20%. Auto makers, who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring, can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales don't pick up, machine tool builders say.<P> Machine tool executives are hopeful, however, that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S.-made machine tools in that region. There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods.<P> However, there's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union's military might. \"The Commerce Department says go, and the Defense Department says stop,\" complains one machine tool producer.<P> If that controversy continues, U.S. machine tool makers say, West German and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in Eastern Europe.<P> September orders for machining centers, lathes, milling machines, grinders, boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled $192.9 million, down 28% from $266.5 million a year earlier, but a 23% increase from August's $156.3 million, NMTBA said.<P> Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to $110.1 million, a 78% rise from $61.7 million a year earlier and a 55% gain from $70.9 million in August. Today's presses are large and costly machines, and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that doesn't necessarily indicate a trend.<P> Machine tool shipments last month were $281.2 million, a 24% rise from a year earlier and a 25% increase from August. Shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year, as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs.<P> U.S. producers had a $2.15 billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of September. That was up 2.8% from a year earlier, even though orders for the first nine months of 1989 were down 19% from the comparable 1988 period.<P> $2,057,750,000. $675,400,000. $1,048,500,000. $588,350,000. ->","completion":" ( ( ( ( Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall, ) ( machine tool makers say, ) ) ( but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums, ) ( but remained 7.7% below year-earlier levels, ) ) ( ( according to figures from NMTBA ) ( -- the Association for Manufacturing Technology. ) ) ) ( ( Domestic machine tool plants received $303 million of orders last month, up 33% from August's $227.1 million, but still below the $328.2 million of September 1988, ) ( NMTBA said.<P> ) ) ) ( ( Machine tools are complex machines ) ( ( ranging from lathes to metal-forming presses ) ( ( that are used ) ( to shape most metal parts.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( \"Overall demand still is very respectable,\" ) ( says Christopher C.

{"prompt":" Texas Instruments Inc., once a pioneer in portable computer technology, today will make a bid to reassert itself in that business by unveiling three small personal computers.<P> The announcements are scheduled to be made in Temple, Texas, and include a so-called \"notebook\" PC that weighs less than seven pounds, has a built-in hard disk drive and is powered by Intel Corp. 's 286 microprocessor. That introduction comes only two weeks after Compaq Computer Corp., believing it had a lead of three to six months on competitors, introduced the first U.S. notebook computer with such features.<P> Despite the inevitable comparison with Compaq, however, Texas Instruments' new notebook won't be a direct competitor. While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers, Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers.<P> The introductions also mark Texas Instruments' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years. Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976, the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been \"dumb\" terminals with limited on-board processing ability. It stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago.<P> Now that is about to change, as Texas Instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives. The laptops are not revolutionary and, indeed, are tardy in a market first opened by GRiD Systems Corp., now a unit of Tandy Corp., almost two years ago.<P> But the notebook, with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk, is more innovative.

{"prompt":" GTE Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. reported strong earnings gains to record levels for the third quarter. Southwestern Bell Corp. and Cincinnati Bell posted slight declines.<P> GTE Corp.<P> GTE said net income rose 18%, aided by higher long-distance calling volumes and an increase in telephone lines in service. Pretax operating profit from telephone operations rose 8.2% but profits from telecommunications products and electrical products were flat.<P> Revenues rose 8.8% to $4.35 billion from $4.0 billion.<P> The company said the quarter included a 10% increase in local-exchange usage for long-distance calling and a 5% increase in the number of access lines in service. Earlier rate reductions in Texas and California reduced the quarter's revenue and operating profit $55 million; a year earlier, operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization.<P> Revenue in the telecommunications products and services unit rose 27% to $728.8 million, but operating profit was unchanged at $26.3 million, partly because of start-up expenses. Electrical products' sales fell to $496.7 million from $504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in Europe and South America. Operating profit of $37.2 million was unchanged.<P> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GTE rose $1.25 to $64.125. MCI Communications Corp.<P> MCI, which stepped up efforts to sell long-distance telephone service to residential customers, reported a 59% jump in earnings. Revenue rose 23% to $1.67 billion from $1.36 billion.<P> Operating profit grew 57% to $269 million from $171 million, while operating margins rose to 16.1% from 15.9% the previous quarter and 12.6% a year ago. Daniel Akerson, MCI chief financial officer, said the company sees further improvements in operating margins. \"We think we can take it to the 18% range over next 18 to 24 months,\" he said.<P> In national over-the-counter trading, MCI fell $2.625 to $42.375. Charles Schellke, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said some investors apparently expected slightly better revenue growth.<P> The company said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with American Telephone & Telegraph's Reach Out America plan. MCI claims about 12% of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under 10% of the $23 billion residential market. It has been trying to improve its share of the residential market. The company wants its business mix to more closely match that of AT&T -- a step it says will help prevent cross subsidization.<P> Mr. Akerson said MCI recorded \"another solid cash positive quarter,\" its fourth in a row, but declined to comment on whether the company is considering a dividend or is planning any acquisition. The current quarter, he said, \"looks fine. We think revenue will continue to grow and that we can control costs and thus improve profitability.\"<P> Southwestern Bell Corp.<P> Southwestern Bell Corp. said net dropped 8.7%, mainly the result of four extraordinary items: a franchise tax refund that its Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit received last year; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third; a rate refund in Missouri and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues.<P> Revenue slipped 1.2% to $2.21 billion from $2.23 billion.<P> The earnings drop had been expected. Chairman Zane E. Barnes said Southwestern Bell's \"businesses are healthy and are continuing to grow.\"<P> The company reported a 3.1% increase in the number of access lines in service, and also said its Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems unit added 30,000 new customers, with a current total of about 333,000.<P> Southwestern shares fell 50 cents to $55.875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.<P> Cincinnati Bell Inc.<P> Cincinnati Bell Inc. said net declined 1.8%.

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cincinnati Bell fell 25 cents to $29.<P> The company said that the number of access lines dropped slightly in the quarter, a decline attributed to seasonal fluctuations.

{"prompt":" The Bush administration said it is submitting a \"comprehensive\" proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations.<P> The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products. But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved. The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years.<P> Trade Representative Carla Hills, who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal, said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S.'s trading partners. Mr. Yeutter, seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000, said the new U.S. proposal wouldn't \"put farmers out of business\" but would only encourage them to \"grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants.\"<P> The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva, hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990. Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more \"fair play\" in services trade, including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies.<P> Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal which struck European countries as too extreme, the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver. For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition. It also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.<P> Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones. Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints, and others with a \"relatively minor trade impact\" would be allowed to continue under certain conditions.<P> The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily. The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the European Community's current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle. The U.S. contends that the rules aren't justified on health grounds.<P> To encourage more competition among exporting countries, the U.S. is proposing that export subsidies, including tax incentives for exporters, be phased out in five years. ->","completion":" ( ( ( ( ( The Bush administration said ) ( ( ( ( it is submitting a \"comprehensive\" proposal ) ( for overhauling agricultural trade ) ) ( that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire ) ( to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products. ) ) ( ( But it would allow considerable flexibility ) ( in determining how and when these goals would be achieved. ) ) ) ( ( The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade ) ( ( by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs ) ( that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Trade Representative Carla Hills, ) ( who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal, ) ) ( ( said ) ( ( she is confident ) ( it will gain considerable support from the U.S.'s trading partners. ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Mr. Yeutter, ) ( ( ( seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan ) ( that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000, ) ) ( said ) ) ) ( ( the new U.S. proposal wouldn't \"put farmers out of business\" ) ( but would only encourage them to \"grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants.\"<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva, ) ( ( hoping ) ( ( that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules ) ( before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990. ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Another U.S. proposal ) ( filed Monday ) ) ( ( urges more \"fair play\" in services trade, ) ( including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal ) ( which struck European countries as too extreme, ) ) ( ( the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver. ) ( ( ( For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear ) ( ( there would be a transition period ) ( ( during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas ) ( to cushion their farmers from foreign competition. ) ) ) ) ( ( It also says ) ( ( countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products ) ( if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, ) ( as the earlier U.S. proposal did, ) ) ( the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones. ) ) ( ( Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints, ) ( and others with a \"relatively minor trade impact\" would be allowed to continue under certain conditions.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures ) ( ( to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules ) ( to impede trade arbitrarily. ) ) ) ( ( ( The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one ) ( ( prompted by the European Community's current attempt ) ( to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle. ) ) ) ( ( The U.S. contends ) ( that the rules aren't justified on health grounds.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( To encourage more competition among exporting countries, ) ( ( the U.S. is proposing ) ( ( ( that export subsidies, ) ( including tax incentives for exporters, ) ) ( be phased out in five years. ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group, which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S., by as much as 15% as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business.<P> Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8%, or 400 people. The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul, during which it also lost as many as 400 employees, a company spokesman said in response to questions. Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc., the group involved, currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000.<P> A few years ago, Mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout. But since then U.S. oil production has declined and Mobil wants to focus its oil-finding efforts overseas.<P> Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring. Mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters.<P> On Wednesday, Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation. Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year.<P> During the coming months, layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous. For greater efficiency, employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction, Mobil said. \"The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations,\" said Charles E. Spruell, president of the Mobil unit.<P> Field offices at New Orleans; Houston; Denver; Midland, Tex.; Bakersfield, Calif.; Oklahoma City; and Liberal, Kan., will be maintained.

{"prompt":" \"Hacksaw\" and \"Bonecrusher\" are the sort of nicknames normally associated with linebackers and heavyweight contenders. Who'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents?<P> Chicago's new school chief is the hard-nosed Ted Kimbrough. At his old job in Compton, Calif., he took a bitter teachers' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member. At his first Chicago press conference, he berated the reporters. In New York City, the new Chancellor, Joseph Fernandez, has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform.<P> Both men fit the mood of the times -- the mood being one of a public fed up with officials' rationalizations for why their schools don't work.<P> Former Patterson, N.J., principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator. The subject of the movie \"Lean on Me,\" Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat. He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline, but isn't it interesting that some of the country's biggest, most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold? Elena Scambio, the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state, says her top priority will be to \"cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy.\"<P> Mr. Fernandez doesn't take control in New York until January, but already he's roiling the waters. He's attacked the concept of \"building tenure,\" one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools. It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals. Once they are in the building, they stay. One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years, despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work. He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack.<P> Naturally, the principals' union loves building tenure, and tenure has withstood previous challenge. We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal, toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they're defending. In his old job, as Dade County chief, Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals. He cut the dropout rate by 5.5%. But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well; incompetent principals and administrators should go, but the good ones ought to be left alone.<P> The situation will be especially delicate for Mr. Kimbrough. He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform. Chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards, one for each school. This of course led to disaster in New York City. Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential, but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them.<P> The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems.

To make its point, it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft.<P> The London Sunday Times, which first reported the U.S. concerns, cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $25 million in \"embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry.\" Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984.<P> A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom, but declined to confirm any details. Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules. President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week.<P> Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules, asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities.<P> Although the legality of these sales is still an open question, the disclosure couldn't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community. \"It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting,\" said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies.<P> The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies, reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies. Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods. But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc.<P> However, these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization. \"There's no evidence that the Soviet program to -LRB-illegally-RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished,\" said a State Department spokesman. ->","completion":" ( ( The Bush administration, ) ( ( trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc, ) ( is questioning ) ) ) ( whether Italy's Ing.

The 21-square-mile area is contaminated with lead, zinc and other metals.<P> Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern, potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter's cleanup costs. The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA, it \"made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization.\" The company, which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday, said that $1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement. The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval, the company said.<P> Gulf Resources added that it \"will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law.\"<P> Under the agreement, Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock.

{"prompt":" British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions, greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.<P> The 50-50 joint venture, which may be dubbed Eurodynamics, would have combined annual sales of at least #1.4 billion -LRB-$2.17 billion-RRB- and would be among the world's largest missile makers. After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance. The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end.<P> The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting. In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture.<P> Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system. Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.<P> The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry. Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC. But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford, Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces.<P> Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF. Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra, Britain's Dowty Group PLC, West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and France's Dassault group.<P> But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid, the source indicated. GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts, which auditors recently said included #215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group, with which Ferranti merged last year. Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry. A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials.<P> A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti: \"Competition is the name of the game,\" she said.<P> At least one potential GEC partner, Matra, insists it isn't interested in Ferranti. \"We have nothing to say about this affair, which doesn't concern us,\" a Matra official said Sunday.<P> The missile venture, the British Aerospace spokeswoman said, is a needed response to the \"new environment\" in defense contracting. For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.<P> The venture's importance for Thomson is great. Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans. The European defense industry is consolidating; for instance, West Germany's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain's Plessey Co., and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.

To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.<P> Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about #950 million, a Thomson spokesman said.

{"prompt":" In what could prove a major addition to the Philippines' foreign-investment portfolio, a Taiwanese company signed a $180 million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex.<P> Taiwan's USI Far East Corp., a petrochemical company, initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker, according to Alson Lee, who heads the Philippine company set up to build and operate the complex. Mr. Lee, president of Luzon Petrochemical Corp., said the contract was signed Wednesday in Tokyo with USI Far East officials. Contract details, however, haven't been made public. The complex is to be located in Batangas, about 70 miles south of Manila.<P> USI Far East will hold a 60% stake in Luzon Petrochemical, according to papers signed with the Philippine government's Board of Investments.<P> The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives, polypropylene and polyethylene. These are the raw materials used in making plastics.<P> The contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project. At an estimated $360 million, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the Philippines since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986. It also is considered critical to the country's efforts to both attract other investment from Taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities. The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade.<P> However, workers can't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the complex are resolved, moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment. As previously reported, a member of the Philippines' House of Representatives has sued to stop the plant. The legislator, Enrique Garcia, had actively backed the plant, but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila. The country's Supreme Court dismissed the suit, but Mr. Garcia late last month filed for a reconsideration.<P> In addition, President Aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff 48% tax on naphtha, the principal raw material to be used in the cracker.<P> However, at a news conference Thursday, Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province. \"We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them, but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province,\" Mrs. Aquino told Manila-based foreign correspondents.<P> The project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project, China General Plastics Corp., backed out. China General Plastics, another Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer, was to have a 40% stake in Luzon Petrochemical.<P> However, Mr. Lee said that USI Far East is confident other investors will take up the slack. He said USI Far East has applied to both the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank's International Finance Corp. for financing that could include equity stakes. ->","completion":" ( ( ( ( ( In what could prove a major addition to the Philippines' foreign-investment portfolio, ) ( ( a Taiwanese company signed a $180 million construction contract ) ( to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Taiwan's USI Far East Corp., a petrochemical company, initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor ) ( to build a naphtha cracker, ) ) ( ( according to Alson Lee, ) ( ( who heads the Philippine company ) ( ( set up ) ( to build and operate the complex. ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Mr. Lee, president of Luzon Petrochemical Corp., said ) ( the contract was signed Wednesday in Tokyo with USI Far East officials. ) ) ( Contract details, however, haven't been made public. ) ) ) ) ( ( ( The complex is to be located in Batangas, about 70 miles south of Manila.<P> ) ( ( USI Far East will hold a 60% stake in Luzon Petrochemical, ) ( ( according to papers ) ( signed with the Philippine government's Board of Investments.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha ) ( ( to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives, polypropylene and polyethylene. ) ( ( These are the raw materials ) ( used in making plastics.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( The contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project. ) ( ( At an estimated $360 million, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the Philippines ) ( since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986. ) ) ) ( ( It also is considered critical to the country's efforts ) ( ( to both attract other investment from Taiwan ) ( and raise heavy industry capabilities. ) ) ) ) ( The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( However, workers can't break ground ) ( ( ( ( until legal maneuvers ) ( to block the complex ) ) ( ( are resolved, moves ) ( which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment. ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( As previously reported, ) ( ( a member of the Philippines' House of Representatives has sued ) ( to stop the plant. ) ) ) ( The legislator, Enrique Garcia, had actively backed the plant, but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila. ) ) ( ( The country's Supreme Court dismissed the suit, ) ( but Mr. Garcia late last month filed for a reconsideration.<P> ) ) ) ( ( In addition, President Aquino has yet to sign into law a bill ) ( ( removing a stiff 48% tax on naphtha, the principal raw material ) ( to be used in the cracker.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( However, at a news conference Thursday, Mrs. Aquino backed the project ) ( ( and said ) ( her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province. ) ) ) ( ( ( \"We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan ) ( ( that maybe this time it will not go to them, ) ( but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province,\" ) ) ) ( Mrs. Aquino told Manila-based foreign correspondents.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( The project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month ) ( ( when the other major partner in the project, China General Plastics Corp., backed out. ) ( China General Plastics, another Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer, was to have a 40% stake in Luzon Petrochemical.<P> ) ) ) ( ( However, Mr. Lee said ) ( ( that USI Far East is confident ) ( other investors will take up the slack. ) ) ) ) ( ( He said ) ( ( USI Far East has applied to both the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank's International Finance Corp. for financing ) ( that could include equity stakes. ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" The dollar finished lower yesterday, after tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street.<P> Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in recent sessions, and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow, when the preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product is released.<P> But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market participants to bid the U.S. unit lower.<P> UAL's decision to remain an independent company sent share prices tumbling. By midmorning, the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down.<P> When the DJIA modestly rebounded, the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday. Stock prices, meanwhile, posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day.<P> Some dealers said that the market's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar. They added that the DJIA's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction it was already headed.<P> In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8355 marks, down from 1.8470 marks Monday, and at 141.45 yen, down from 141.90 yen late Monday. Sterling was quoted at $1.6055, up from $1.6030 late Monday.<P> In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.57 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen.<P> Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, sees a break in the dollar's long-term upward trend, a trend that began in January 1988.<P> He argues that the dollar is now \"moving sideways,\" adding that \"the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase.\"<P> Analysts peg the dollar's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy, highlighted by recent economic data, particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap.<P> They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors.<P> Despite several spurts of dollar trading, it was noted that mark-yen cross trade grabbed much of the market's attention.<P> Following the dive in U.S. stocks, the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts. Traders attribute the mark's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials. But, they add that the mark's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments.<P> \"The question remains: how much can the West German market absorb?\" says one senior dealer.<P> Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy won't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark.<P> Despite the yen's weakness with respect to the mark, Tokyo traders say they don't expect the Bank of Japan to take any action to support the Japanese currency on that front.<P> Meanwhile, sterling slumped on news that the United Kingdom posted a wider-than-expected trade deficit in September.

{"prompt":" Federal drug regulators, concerned over British reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to human-based insulin, say they are considering a study to see if similar deaths have occurred here.<P> The United Kingdom reports came from Dr. Patrick Toseland, head of clinical chemistry at Guy's Hospital in London. In a telephone interview Friday, Dr. Toseland said the number of sudden, unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985. At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year, he said.<P> Dr. Solomon Sobel, director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said FDA officials have discussed Dr. Toseland's findings \"fairly intensively.\" While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the U.S., Dr. Sobel said the FDA plans to examine Dr. Toseland's evidence and is considering its own study here.<P> Dr. Toseland, a toxicologist, said he was preparing an article for a British forensic medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which can kill diabetics.<P> The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating, anxiety and cramps. With proper warning, diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food. \"The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia,\" Dr. Toseland said.<P> At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Dr. Robert E. Silverman, chief of the diabetes program branch, said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics that has been under way at NIH for five years. However, he said officials conducting the study hadn't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness. \"We are now monitoring for it much more closely,\" he said.<P> \"We do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar,\" Dr. Sobel said. The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster, he said. \"But we don't believe there is enough of a difference to be clinically significant,\" Dr. Sobel said.<P> Reports of Dr. Toseland's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there. Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines -- Britain's equivalent of the U.S. FDA -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland's findings. On Friday, the American Diabetes Association issued a similar statement urging the six million U.S. diabetics not to overreact to the British report.<P> \"A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used,\" the American association said.<P> The FDA already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products.<P> Eli Lilly & Co., the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer, dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product known as Humulin. Lilly is building plants to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein, France. In its latest annual report, Lilly said Humulin sales have shown \"excellent growth.\"<P> Lilly officials said they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin, but didn't know if the problem had caused any deaths. Dr. Leigh Thompson, a Lilly group vice president, said the company's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product.<P> Dr. Toseland said most of the British diabetics who died had been taking a human-based insulin made by Novo\/Nordisk, a Danish manufacturer.

{"prompt":" The real estate slump that's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city's retail real estate market.<P> In Manhattan, once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill. Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy, turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom.<P> \"There is an unbelievable amount of space available,\" says Faith Consolo, senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc. There are about 2,000 stores for rent, up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500. \"This further confuses retailers,\" she says. \"They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down? Is this the wrong time to open a store? Who is going to be in the space next door?\"<P> In addition, Ms. Consolo says, tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one-quarter lower than landlords' initial asking price.<P> A handful of hot retail locations, such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas, have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents. And, in some neighborhoods, rents have merely hit a plateau. But on average, Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10% to 15% in the past six months alone, experts say. That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months, after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986.<P> The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing. \"As businesses contract or depart, the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks,\" says Edward A. Friedman, senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc.<P> He says financial problems plaguing electronics, fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market. Hardest hit are what he calls \"secondary\" sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents. In these locations, Mr. Friedman says, \"Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined.\" Weakness in the restaurant industry, which is leaving retail space vacant, exacerbates the problem for landlords.<P> It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores, which anchor retail neighborhoods, are in doubt. Hooker Corp., parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman's, is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale's is for sale by its owner, Campeau Corp.<P> The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents. But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed.<P> Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap. New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities. Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $500 a square foot, and $250 is not uncommon. The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $100 a square foot, as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue. By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $100 a square foot. And rents on Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive generally don't exceed about $125 a square foot.<P> The New York Stock Exchange said two securities will begin trading this week.<P> Precision Castparts Corp., Portland, Ore., will begin trading with the symbol PCP.

{"prompt":" China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year, a Western government report says, unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit.<P> According to the report, completed last month, if China's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year, the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991. A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports. The $14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much.<P> The report by the Western government, which declines to be identified, concludes that \"a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to below 5% per annum.\"<P> According to Chinese customs figures, import growth has slowed in recent months, dropping to 16% in July and 7.1% in August from the year-earlier periods, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.<P> But before import growth slowed, China's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves. The $14 billion level in June marked a drop from $19 billion at the end of April. China's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $10.6 billion in June 1985 from $16.6 billion the previous September.<P> China might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline, when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency. But this time, China faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings June 4.<P> For example, China's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4. Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $1.3 billion, down from $2.2 billion last year. Because of this and the huge trade gap, the deficit in China's current account, which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds, is expected to widen sharply from the $3.8 billion deficit last year.<P> The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China's current-account balance, two of which are considered most likely.<P> In one, imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25% and 5% recorded during the first seven months, and the current-account deficit widens to $13.1 billion. In 1985, China had a record deficit of $11.4 billion.<P> The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months. In this case, China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $8.7 billion, based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20% and exports 10%.<P> If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders, it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit. But since June, foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China. Even if borrowing resumes, commercial bankers aren't expected to lend as much as before.<P> In addition, economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China's deteriorating political and economic environment. On top of all this, foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992.<P> With less capital coming in, China's balance of payments would suffer. The Western government report's first scenario assumes a 30% reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5% contraction in foreign direct investment. In the second, foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10% and investment to drop 10%.<P> But in either case, the report says, China's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves, which are used to finance the imbalance. In the first scenario, the reserves would be exhausted next year, and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991. ->","completion":" ( ( ( ( ( China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year, ) ( a Western government report says, ) ) ( ( unless imports are cut drastically ) ( to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( According to the report, ) ( completed last month, ) ) ( ( ( if China's trade gap continues to widen at the pace ) ( seen in the first seven months of this year, ) ) ( ( the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991. ) ( ( ( ( A country is considered financially healthy ) ( if its reserves cover three months of its imports. ) ) ( ( ( The $14 billion of reserves ) ( China had in June ) ) ( would cover just that much.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( The report by the Western government, ) ( which declines to be identified, ) ) ( concludes that ) ) ( ( \"a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided ) ( only if import growth drops to below 5% per annum.\"<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( According to Chinese customs figures, ) ( ( ( ( ( import growth has slowed in recent months, ) ( dropping to 16% in July and 7.1% in August from the year-earlier periods, ) ) ( compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( But ) ( ( before import growth slowed, ) ( China's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves. ) ) ) ( The $14 billion level in June marked a drop from $19 billion at the end of April. ) ) ( China's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $10.6 billion in June 1985 from $16.6 billion the previous September.<P> ) ) ) ( ( China might stave off a crisis ) ( ( if it acts as forcefully ) ( ( as it did ) ( ( ( to arrest the 1985 decline, ) ( ( when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending ) ( and devalued the currency. ) ) ) ( ( But this time, China faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces ) ( that have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings June 4.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( For example, China's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4. ) ( Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $1.3 billion, down from $2.2 billion last year. ) ) ( ( ( Because of this and the huge trade gap, the deficit in China's current account, ) ( which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds, ) ) ( is expected to widen sharply from the $3.8 billion deficit last year.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China's current-account balance, two of which are considered most likely.<P> ) ( ( ( ( In one, imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25% and 5% ) ( recorded during the first seven months, ) ) ( ( and the current-account deficit widens to $13.1 billion. ) ( In 1985, China had a record deficit of $11.4 billion.<P> ) ) ) ( ( The other scenario assumes ) ( ( ( ( that Beijing takes effective actions ) ( to curb imports in the coming months. ) ) ( ( In this case, China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $8.7 billion, ) ( ( based on projections ) ( that imports for all of this year grow 20% and exports 10%.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders, ) ( ( it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves ) ( ( by using some loan funds ) ( to offset the current-account deficit. ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( But since June, foreign bankers ) ( led by international financial institutions ) ) ( have virtually suspended their new loans to China. ) ) ( ( Even if borrowing resumes, ) ( commercial bankers aren't expected to lend as much as before.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( In addition, economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments ) ( as businessmen become increasingly wary of China's deteriorating political and economic environment. ) ) ( On top of all this, foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( With less capital coming in, ) ( ( China's balance of payments would suffer. ) ( ( ( The Western government report's first scenario assumes a 30% reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5% contraction in foreign direct investment. ) ( In the second, foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10% and investment to drop 10%.<P> ) ) ( ( ( But in either case, ) ( the report says, ) ) ( ( ( China's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves, ) ( ( which are used ) ( to finance the imbalance. ) ) ) ( ( In the first scenario, the reserves would be exhausted next year, ) ( and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" Procter & Gamble Co., helped by a gain from a lawsuit settlement and continued growth overseas, posted a 38% rise in fiscal first-quarter net income.<P> Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 climbed to $551 million, or $1.66 a share, from $400 million, or $1.18 a share, a year earlier. Per-share figures have been adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split effective Oct. 20. Sales increased 6% to $5.58 billion from $5.27 billion.<P> Earnings at the consumer-products giant were boosted by a gain of $125 million, or about 25 cents a share, stemming from last month's settlement of litigation with three of P&G's competitors over patents on P&G's Duncan Hines cookies.<P> Excluding the gain, P&G's earnings were close to analysts' predictions of about $1.40 a share for the quarter. Wall Street had expected a modest rise in the company's domestic sales and earnings, and more substantial increases in overseas results. One factor helping sales and earnings was a 3% price rise for most P&G products, except coffee, analysts said.<P> Unit volume, or amount of products shipped, rose about 11% in the international segment, with P&G continuing to win market share in Japan's diaper and detergent markets. Jay Freedman, analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., said P&G's Always sanitary napkin, sold under the Whisper name in Japan, has firmly established itself as a leading brand. He figures P&G will expand its personal-care product line in Japan to \"continue that momentum.\"<P> P&G's U.S. shipments were up just 1%, partly because the company decided to shift more promotions and sales for health and beauty products to the fiscal second quarter. Hugh Zurkuhlen, analyst with Salomon Bros., predicts the shift will mean P&G's sales growth in the second quarter will be \"in the double digits.\"<P> Also slowing growth in the U.S. were lackluster results for P&G's cooking oils, which had a strong year-earlier first quarter. Last year's drought in the Midwest prompted retailers to stock up on oils ahead of anticipated price increases, boosting sales for Crisco and Puritan oils, analysts said.<P> For fiscal 1990, analysts expect P&G's sales to continue to grow, with earnings climbing between 15% and 20%. Lynne Hyman, vice president of equity research for First Boston Corp., expects P&G to post net of about $4.20 a share, on a post-split basis. \"But I'm recognizing there's a good chance they'll do a bit better than that,\" she says.

Moreover, a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl.<P> But many economists pointed to a 1.8% September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category. That \"suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart,\" said Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York.

Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56%, and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases, including airplanes, missiles, ships, tanks and communications equipment.<P> Orders for military goods usually catapult in September, government officials say, as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders.<P> Without the increase in defense bookings, September orders would have plummeted 3.9%.<P> Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping. Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4% in September, to $476.14 billion, after declining for the first time in 2 1\/2 years in August. In July unfilled orders grew 1%.

{"prompt":" Britain's current account deficit dropped to #1.6 billion -LRB-$2.56 billion-RRB- in September from an adjusted #2 billion -LRB-$3.21 billion-RRB- the previous month, but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the U.K. economy next year.<P> The Confederation of British Industry's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown, largely because of a 16-month series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks' base lending rates to 15%.<P> \"The outlook has deteriorated since the summer, with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill,\" said David Wigglesworth, chairman of the industry group's economic committee. He also said investment by businesses is falling off. Of 1,224 companies surveyed, 31% expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery, while only 28% plan to spend more.<P> But despite mounting recession fears, government data don't yet show the economy grinding to a halt. Unemployment, for example, has continued to decline, and the September trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports.<P> As a result, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government isn't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring, if then. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation, which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987. Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies.<P> Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday, Mr. Lawson said inflation \"remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being\" and promised to take \"whatever steps are needed\" to choke it off. The latest government figures said retail prices in September were up 7.6% from a year earlier.<P> Many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year. David Owen, U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group, reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7% from 1.2% and termed the risk of recession next year \"quite high.\" But he said the downturn probably won't become a \"major contraction\" similar to those of 1974 and 1982.<P> Still, Britain's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the European Community's plan to create a unified market by 1992. Compared with the major economies on the Continent, the U.K. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months. As a result, Mr. Owen warned, investment will be more likely to flow toward the other European economies and \"the U.K. will be less prepared for the single market.\"<P> Britain's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy, such as a surge in the volume of exports, which were 8.5% higher than a year earlier.

{"prompt":" Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa: a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.<P> For several months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight. The explosion sent shards of metal flying, severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems, and led to the crash that killed 112 people.<P> But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa. The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City. Among the issues the board will examine is whether United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks. The engine involved was a CF6-6 made by General Electric Co.<P> Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as \"hard alpha\" -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago. He said there wasn't any way to detect the flaw at that time, and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur.<P> The FAA already has ordered that all 232 disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber. Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident \"won't happen again,\" said Mr. Broderick. A spokesman for GE said that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue and \"will comply fully with the required inspections.\" But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on GE's engine production. The CF6-6 series engines aren't being manufactured any more; they are only being used in the DC-10 Series 10 planes currently in service, he said. ->","completion":" ( Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa: ) ( ( a structural flaw ) ( that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( For several months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected ) ( ( that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack ) ( that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight. ) ) ) ( ( ( The explosion sent shards of metal flying, ) ( severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems, ) ) ( ( and led to the crash ) ( that killed 112 people.<P> ) ) ) ) ( But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa. ) ) ( ( The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City. ) ( ( ( Among the issues ) ( the board will examine ) ) ( is whether United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks. ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( The engine involved was a CF6-6 ) ( made by General Electric Co.<P> ) ) ( ( Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said ) ( ( that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate ) ( ( ( that a flaw ) ( -- known as \"hard alpha\" -- ) ) ( occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago. ) ) ) ) ) ( ( He said ) ( ( ( there wasn't any way ) ( to detect the flaw at that time, ) ) ( ( and that the process has since been changed ) ( ( to decrease the chance ) ( that such flaws would occur.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( The FAA already has ordered ) ( ( ( that all 232 disks ) ( made by the old process ) ) ( ( be removed from the planes ) ( and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber. ) ) ) ) ( ( Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident \"won't happen again,\" ) ( said Mr. Broderick. ) ) ) ( ( ( A spokesman for GE said ) ( ( that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue ) ( and \"will comply fully with the required inspections.\" ) ) ) ( ( ( But he also pointed out ) ( that the recalls will have no impact on GE's engine production. ) ) ( ( ( The CF6-6 series engines aren't being manufactured any more; ) ( they are only being used in the DC-10 Series 10 planes currently in service, ) ) ( he said. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" A frozen mountaintop in Tibet may offer an important clue about whether the Earth is warming perilously.<P> Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years.<P> The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times, largely because of pollutants in the air, and will warm far more in the century ahead. A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth's polar ice caps, raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas.<P> \"If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past, you have much more confidence in predictions for the future,\" said Lonnie Thompson, a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples.<P> To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years, researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen. These measurements can indicate temperature changes, researchers said, because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change.<P> Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap, a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age, Mr. Thompson said. Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans, which moderate temperature changes.<P> But the ice-core samples aren't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating, Mr. Thompson acknowledged. According to greenhouse theories, increased carbon dioxide emissions, largely caused by burning of fossil fuels, will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space.<P> Skeptics say that if that's the case, temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century, reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide.

{"prompt":" Are consumers too deep in hock?<P> A lot of observers think so, and, if they're right, the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt. A sudden, forced cutback by consumers, who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity, would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments can't readily take up the slack. And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions.<P> The worriers cite some worrisome trends. During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion, inflation-adjusted gross national product, disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30%, but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66%. And the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income -- personal income after taxes -- has hit a high of about 18 1\/2%.<P> However, these figures don't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board. In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco, Mr. Durkin comments that \"installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences.\" He adds: \"We are now witnessing a slowdown which, if history is a guide, could persist for a while.\"<P> But what about the debt burden? Mr. Durkin doubts that \"there is some magic level\" at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income \"indicates economic problems.\" And, \"more importantly,\" he says, \"the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters.\"<P> The chart below shows why -LRB-see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989-RRB-. The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply, and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed. Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be \"lower in this cycle than earlier,\" Mr. Durkin says. He notes that some \"revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit\" being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing.

This estimate doesn't include claims under workers' compensation, life, health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges, highways and public buildings.<P> The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $4 billion in claims that insurers face from Hurricane Hugo, which ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month. That's because only about 30% of California homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses.<P> However, insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the Bay area earthquake, Hugo and last week's explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co. 's refinery in Pasadena, Texas, will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump.<P> Other insurance rates such as casualty insurance, which would cover liability claims, aren't likely to firm right away, says Alice Cornish, an industry analyst with Northington Research in Avon, Conn. She believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes isn't likely to halt the growth of the industry's surplus capital next year.<P> Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first, analysts and brokers believe. \"The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters\" in the U.S. as well as in Great Britain and Europe, says Thomas Rosencrants, director of research at Interstate\/Johnson Lane Inc. in Atlanta.<P> Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses. Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company, which, in turn, accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy. Insurers, such as Cigna Corp., Transamerica Corp, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co., buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and Lloyd's of London for one catastrophe at a time.<P> After Hugo hit, many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year.<P> After the earthquake two weeks ago, brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and Lloyd's syndicates turned to the London market excess lines for protection of their own.<P> James Snedeker, senior vice president of Gill & Roeser Inc., a New York-based reinsurance broker, says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990. However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly.

{"prompt":" When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure.<P> For the first time, the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority. This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.<P> But are these four players, three of them in their 80s, ready to assume a different role after 88 years, collectively, of service on the high court?<P> Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role, and the frustrations that go with it, but in different ways. Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad.<P> The four justices are no newcomers to dissent, often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court's conservative drift. But always, in years past, they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases. Now, however, as the court's new five-member conservative majority continues to solidify, victories for the liberals are rare.<P> The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren. In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court. Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions, with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory.<P> But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech. \"Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result,\" he said. Moreover, in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s, he knew that the tables might turn in the future. He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt, a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court's opinions.<P> Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was \"depressed\" about the court's direction last spring, but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights. \"We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but I'm not going to do it,\" he said in a speech last month.<P> He, like Justice Brennan, considers dissents highly important for the future, a point that hasn't escaped legal scholars. Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a \"generation-skipping\" flavor to current dissents. The dissenters in the Warren Court, he says, appeared to be writing for the short-term, suggesting that the court's direction might change soon. \"Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future,\" he says.<P> Justice Blackmun, who will turn 81 next month, also seems feisty about his new role. Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues, especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion, Roe vs. Wade.<P> Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years. And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August.<P> But his level of frustration showed in a recent, impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago.

{"prompt":" The oil industry's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year.<P> Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability. The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.<P> The industry is \"seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals,\" Glenn Cox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., said in an interview. \"That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings\" for the industry in general, he added. He didn't forecast Phillips's results.<P> But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings. So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.<P> Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene, a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies. It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound. A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents, peaking at about 34 cents last December.<P> A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion. Beginning in mid-1987, prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand. Companies added capacity furiously. Now, greatly increased supplies are on the market, while the dollar is stronger, and domestic economic growth is slower.<P> Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker. \"Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year,\" said William Randol, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp.<P> Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that didn't materialize. The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period. In addition, crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier, further pressuring profitability.<P> Refiners say margins picked up in September, and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter. During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits.<P> Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year. Prices -- averaging roughly $2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies' expectations. Demand has been much stronger than anticipated, and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter. \"We could see higher oil prices this year,\" said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.<P> That will translate into sharply higher production profits, particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $13 a barrel in the fourth quarter.<P> While oil prices have been better than expected, natural gas prices have been worse. In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less than they were in 1988. The main reason remains weather. Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use. This summer, on the other hand, had milder weather than usual.<P> \"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices,\" said Mr. Cox, Phillips's president. \"The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected.\"<P> Going into the fourth quarter, natural gas prices are anywhere from 8% to 17% lower than a year earlier. For instance, natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $1.47 a thousand cubic feet, down 13% from $1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago. ->","completion":" The oil industry's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year.<P> ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings ) ( than they did for the third quarter a year ago, ) ) ( largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability. ) ) ( ( ( ( The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, ) ( but chemicals are likely to remain weak, ) ) ( industry executives and analysts say, ) ) ( ( reducing chances ) ( that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( The industry is \"seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals,\" ) ( Glenn Cox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., said in an interview. ) ) ( ( ( \"That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings\" for the industry in general, ) ( he added. ) ) ( ( ( He didn't forecast Phillips's results.<P> ) ( ( But securities analysts say ) ( ( Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices ) ( and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings. ) ) ) ) ( ( ( So, too, ) ( many analysts predict, ) ) ( will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene, a major commodity chemical ) ( produced in vast amounts by many oil companies. ) ) ( ( It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound. ) ( ( A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents, ) ( peaking at about 34 cents last December.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion. ) ( ( ( ( Beginning in mid-1987, ) ( ( prices began accelerating ) ( as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand. ) ) ) ( Companies added capacity furiously. ) ) ( ( Now, greatly increased supplies are on the market, ) ( ( while the dollar is stronger, ) ( and domestic economic growth is slower.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker. ) ( ( ( \"Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year ) ( and generally not very good this year,\" ) ) ( said William Randol, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Oil company refineries ran flat out ) ( ( to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August ) ( that didn't materialize. ) ) ) ( The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period. ) ) ( ( In addition, crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier, ) ( further pressuring profitability.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Refiners say ) ( margins picked up in September, ) ) ( ( ( and many industry officials believe ) ( gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter. ) ) ( During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year. ) ( ( ( ( ( Prices ) ( -- averaging roughly $2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- ) ) ( have stayed well above most companies' expectations. ) ) ( ( ( ( Demand has been much stronger ) ( than anticipated, ) ) ( and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter. ) ) ( ( \"We could see higher oil prices this year,\" ) ( said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( That will translate into sharply higher production profits, ) ( ( particularly compared with last year ) ( when oil prices steadily fell to below $13 a barrel in the fourth quarter.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( While oil prices have been better ) ( than expected, ) ) ( natural gas prices have been worse. ) ) ( ( In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less ) ( than they were in 1988. ) ) ) ( ( The main reason remains weather. ) ( ( ( Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought ) ( ( that caused utilities to burn more natural gas ) ( to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use. ) ) ) ( This summer, on the other hand, had milder weather than usual.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( \"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices,\" ) ( said Mr. Cox, Phillips's president. ) ) ( ( ( \"The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance ) ( as many had expected.\"<P> ) ) ( ( ( Going into the fourth quarter, ) ( natural gas prices are anywhere from 8% to 17% lower than a year earlier. ) ) ( ( ( For instance, natural gas ) ( currently produced along the Gulf Coast ) ) ( is selling on the spot market for around $1.47 a thousand cubic feet, down 13% from $1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" Short interest in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose 6% as of mid-October, its biggest jump since 6.3% last April.<P> The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled Oct. 13, the day the Nasdaq composite index slid 3% and the New York Stock Exchange tumbled 7%. The coincidence might lead to the conclusion that short-sellers bet heavily on that day that OTC stocks would decline further.<P> As it happens, the Nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge. However, the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers include only those trades completed, or settled, by Oct. 13, rather than trades that occurred on that day, according to Gene Finn, chief economist for the NASD. Generally, it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade.<P> The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares, up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987. The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2% decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3% rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September-October period.<P> Generally, a short seller expects a fall in a stock's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later; the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold. Short interest, which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold, but not yet replaced, can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks.<P> Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues, short interest rose to 196.8 million shares, from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September. Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive, Intel, Campeau and LIN Broadcasting.<P> Short interest in First Executive, an insurance issue, rose 55% to 3.8 million. Intel's short interest jumped 42%, while Campeau's increased 62%. Intel makes semiconductors and Campeau operates department-store chains and is strained for cash.<P> Meritor Savings again had the dubious honor of being the OTC stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq. Meritor has headed the list since May. First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line.<P> Short selling isn't necessarily bad for the overall market. Shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying. In addition, changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage.

{"prompt":" Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room.<P> Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload.<P> The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds. It also marks P&G's growing concern that its Japanese rivals, such as Kao Corp., may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S.<P> The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, called Attack, which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets. \"They don't want to get caught again,\" says one industry watcher.<P> Retailers in Phoenix, Ariz., say P&G's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November. A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month. She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others.<P> Superconcentrates aren't entirely new for P&G. The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack. When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%. With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%.<P> While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders. The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties, including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach. With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine, believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry.<P> In the early 1980s, P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe. But the product, which wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped.<P> P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches, but they haven't sold well, despite the convenience.<P> But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading. And retailers are expected to embrace the product, in part because it will take up less shelf space. \"When shelf space was cheap, bigger was better,\" says Hugh Zurkuhlen, an analyst at Salomon Bros. But with so many brands vying for space, that's no longer the case. If the new Cheer sells well, the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates. Then retailers \"will probably push the {less-established} brands out altogether,\" he says.<P> Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market.<P> Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S., but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co., a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker. It also has a product-testing facility in California.<P> Some believe P&G's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese. \"This is something P&G would do with or without Kao,\" says Mr. Zurkuhlen. ->","completion":" Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room.<P> ) ( ( ( ( ( ( Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent ) ( that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( The move stems from lessons ) ( ( learned in Japan ) ( where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds. ) ) ) ( ( It also marks P&G's growing concern ) ( that its Japanese rivals, such as Kao Corp., may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan ) ( ( ( when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, ) ( called Attack, ) ) ( which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets. ) ) ) ( ( \"They don't want to get caught again,\" ) ( says one industry watcher.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Retailers in Phoenix, Ariz., say ) ( ( ( P&G's new powdered detergent ) ( -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- ) ) ( will be on shelves in that market by early November. ) ) ) ( ( ( A P&G spokeswoman confirmed ) ( that shipments to Phoenix started late last month. ) ) ( ( She said ) ( ( the company will study results from this market ) ( before expanding to others.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Superconcentrates aren't entirely new for P&G. ) ( ( The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan ) ( after watching the success of Attack. ) ) ) ( ( ( When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, ) ( P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%. ) ) ( With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, ) ( ( the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market, ) ( ( where growth is slow ) ( and liquids have gained prominence over powders. ) ) ) ) ( ( ( The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name ) ( ( since it's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties, ) ( including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach. ) ) ) ( ( With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more; ) ( ( many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine, ) ( ( believing ) ( that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( In the early 1980s, P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name ) ( that it markets in Europe. ) ) ( ( ( ( But the product, ) ( which wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, ) ) ( bombed in a market test in Denver ) ) ( and was dropped.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches, ) ( ( but they haven't sold well, ) ( despite the convenience.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( But P&G contends ) ( ( the new Cheer is a unique formula ) ( ( that also offers an ingredient ) ( that prevents colors from fading. ) ) ) ) ( ( ( And retailers are expected to embrace the product, ) ( in part because it will take up less shelf space. ) ) ( ( ( ( ( \"When shelf space was cheap, ) ( bigger was better,\" ) ) ( says Hugh Zurkuhlen, an analyst at Salomon Bros. ) ) ( ( ( But with so many brands ) ( vying for space, ) ) ( that's no longer the case. ) ) ) ( ( ( ( If the new Cheer sells well, ) ( ( the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate ) ( as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates. ) ) ) ( Then retailers \"will probably push the {less-established} brands out altogether,\" ) ) ( he says.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( Competition is bound to get tougher ) ( if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. ) ) ( ( To be sure, ) ( ( Kao wouldn't have an easy time ) ( ( taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, ) ( which has about 23% of the market.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( Kao officials previously have said ) ( ( ( they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S., ) ( but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co., a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker. ) ) ( It also has a product-testing facility in California.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Some believe ) ( P&G's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese. ) ) ( ( ( \"This is something ) ( P&G would do with or without Kao,\" ) ) ( says Mr. Zurkuhlen. ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a \"monster.\" Needless to say, he was talking about RICO. With its recently revised guidelines for RICO, Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors.<P> The text of the \"new policy\" guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby. They strongly suggest that Justice's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Princeton\/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness. Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics. This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets.<P> The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others. This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton\/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases. The forfeiture memo cited \"considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process.\" It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are \"less intrusive\" alternatives, such as bonds, and in any case not to seek forfeitures \"disproportionate to the defendant's crime.\"<P> These changes come a tad late for Princeton\/Newport, the first RICOed securities firm. It was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture. Princeton\/Newport investors, including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment, made the rational decision to withdraw their money; for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later. Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000.<P> The experience of Princeton\/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank. Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges \"which the company is not in a position to dispute\" because of RICO. Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose. So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, Drexel did wrong.<P> So two cheers for the new rules. Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova, who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals.<P> But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors. Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, \"RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence.\" He said ours is supposed to be \"a government of laws not of men,\" and yet RICO defenders \"tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO.\" No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.<P> What now for Princeton\/Newport officials, Drexel and Mr. Milken? Justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred. We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name. ->","completion":" ( ( ( The Justice Department is in the process ) ( ( of trying to gain control over a law ) ( that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a \"monster.\" ) ) ) ( ( Needless to say, ) ( he was talking about RICO. ) ) ) ( ( ( ( With its recently revised guidelines for RICO, ) ( Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors.<P> ) ) ( ( ( The text of the \"new policy\" guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby. ) ( ( ( ( They strongly suggest ) ( that Justice's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Princeton\/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness. ) ) ( Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics. ) ) ( ( This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, ) ( who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others. ) ( ( This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division ) ( prohibiting Princeton\/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases. ) ) ) ( ( ( The forfeiture memo cited \"considerable criticism in the press, ) ( ( because of a perception ) ( ( that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property ) ( without due process.\" ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures ) ( if there are \"less intrusive\" alternatives, such as bonds, ) ) ( and in any case not to seek forfeitures \"disproportionate to the defendant's crime.\"<P> ) ) ( ( These changes come a tad late for Princeton\/Newport, the first RICOed securities firm. ) ( ( ( ( It was forced into liquidation before trial ) ( when investors yanked their funds ) ) ( after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture. ) ) ( ( ( ( ( Princeton\/Newport investors, ) ( including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment, ) ) ( ( made the rational decision ) ( to withdraw their money; ) ) ) ( ( for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later. ) ( Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( The experience of Princeton\/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel ) ( that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank. ) ) ( ( Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement ) ( ( ( allowing it to plea to charges ) ( ( ( \"which the company is not in a position ) ( to dispute\" ) ) ( because of RICO. ) ) ) ( ( Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose. ) ( So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, Drexel did wrong.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( So two cheers for the new rules. ) ) ) ( ( ( Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova, ) ( who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( But prosecutorial guidelines are effective ) ( only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors. ) ) ( ( Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech ) ( ( titled, \"RICO: ) ( The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence.\" ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( He said ) ( ours is supposed to be \"a government of laws not of men,\" ) ) ( ( and yet RICO defenders \"tell us ) ( ( that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion ) ( to protect against overbreadth of RICO.\" ) ) ) ) ( ( ( No prosecutorial guidelines, ) ( observed or unobserved, ) ) ( limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.<P> ) ) ) ( ( What now for Princeton\/Newport officials, Drexel and Mr. Milken? ) ( ( ( Justice should review these cases ) ( to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred. ) ) ( ( We suspect ) ( ( that Justice will some day agree ) ( that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" The U.S., which is finalizing its steel-import quotas, is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries.<P> Meanwhile, the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan's steel quota, and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community.<P> Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30. Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990.<P> In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation. Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers, with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which isn't included in the quota program. Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel. Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas.<P> The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas, known as voluntary restraint agreements, until March 31, 1992. It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade, which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments. The U.S. termed its plan, a \"trade liberalization program,\" despite the fact that it is merely an extension.<P> Mexico, which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas. South Korea, which had 1.9% under the previous quotas, is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%. That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included. Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43% share it has had in recent years.<P> The EC and Japan -- the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers -- haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent. The EC steel industry, which has been coping with strong European demand, has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%. Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%.<P> In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988. But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984. Japan, however, has agreed to cut its quota to about 5% from 5.9% previously.<P> Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program. The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela.<P> The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks. That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance.<P> Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market to allocate.<P> These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries. ->","completion":" ( ( ( ( ( ( The U.S., ) ( which is finalizing its steel-import quotas, ) ) ( ( is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries ) ( which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries.<P> ) ) ) ( ( Meanwhile, the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan's steel quota, ) ( and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community.<P> ) ) ) ( ( Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market ) ( ( than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, ) ( which expired Sept. 30. ) ) ) ) ( ( Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries ) ( ( that haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ) ( ending Oct. 1, 1990.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel ) ( used annually by the nation. ) ) ( ( ( ( Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers, with the difference ) ( ( supplied mainly by Canada ) ( -- which isn't included in the quota program. ) ) ) ( ( ( Other countries ) ( that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, ) ) ( also have supplied steel. ) ) ) ( ( ( Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. ) ( that are similar to quotas.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( The Bush administration earlier this year said ) ( ( ( it would extend steel quotas, ) ( known as voluntary restraint agreements, ) ) ( until March 31, 1992. ) ) ) ( ( It also said ) ( ( it would use that two-and-a-half year period ) ( ( to work toward an international consensus ) ( ( on freeing up the international steel trade, ) ( which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments. ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( The U.S. termed its plan, a \"trade liberalization program,\" ) ( ( despite the fact ) ( that it is merely an extension.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Mexico, ) ( ( which was one of the first countries ) ( to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., ) ) ) ( virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas. ) ) ( ( ( ( South Korea, ) ( which had 1.9% under the previous quotas, ) ) ( ( is set ) ( to get a small increase to about 1.95%. ) ) ) ( ( That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market ) ( if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included. ) ) ) ( ( Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43% share ) ( it has had in recent years.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( The EC and Japan ) ( -- the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers -- ) ) ( haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent. ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( The EC steel industry, ) ( which has been coping with strong European demand, ) ) ( has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market ) ) ( compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%. ) ) ( ( Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market ) ( compared with a quota of 5.9%.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988. ) ( But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984. ) ) ( Japan, however, has agreed to cut its quota to about 5% from 5.9% previously.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel ) ( imported to the U.S. under the quota program. ) ) ( The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela.<P> ) ) ( ( ( The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market ) ( to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks. ) ) ( That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance.<P> ) ) ) ) ( ( ( Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year ) ( when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market to allocate.<P> ) ) ( ( These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration's steel-quota program ) ( ( to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers ) ( to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

The average yield on both two-year CDs and five-year CDs was 7.98%.<P> Only CDs sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week, reflecting increased yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction.

{"prompt":" General Motors Corp., in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada, has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity.<P> In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.<P> GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade. The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992. Just a month ago, GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987.<P> Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s. One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match. Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year. GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin.<P> The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs. Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's \"flagrant insensitivity\" toward union members. The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed \"disarray\" and an \"inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information,\" Mr. Yokich said.<P> GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves:<P> Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich. That means two plants -- one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991. The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio. Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.<P> But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec.<P> Workers at plants in Van Nuys, Calif., Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Mich., were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars. GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec, company and union officials said.<P> That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures. The Van Nuys plant, which employs about 3,000 workers, doesn't have a product to build after 1993. Jerry Shrieves, UAW local president, said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a \"flex plant,\" which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand.<P> At the Oklahoma City plant, which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars, Steve Featherston, UAW local vice president, said the plant has no new product lined up, and \"none of us knows\" when the A-body cars will die. He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s.<P> At Pontiac, however, the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied, two-seater Pontiac Fiero model.<P> The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year.

{"prompt":" With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S.<P> Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view. Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.<P> Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade. He said such results should be \"measurable in dollars and cents\" in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.<P> But Mrs. Hills, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday, stressed that the objective \"is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action.\" She added that she expected \"perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest.\"<P> How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months. American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills. Many called it simply a contrast in styles. But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic. Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand. And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.<P> Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's, Mrs. Hills replied: \"I didn't hear every word he spoke, but as a general proposition, I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration.\" Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly \"conciliatory.\"<P> \"I think my line has been very consistent,\" Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. \"I am painted sometimes as ferocious, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement. I don't feel very ferocious. I don't feel either hard or soft. I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade.\"<P> When she met the local press for the first time on Friday, Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill. She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified. But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition. She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and shouldn't be tackled by setting quantitative targets.<P> At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief. \"My impression was that you would be a scary old lady,\" he said, drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues. \"But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity.\"<P> Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials, about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market. The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years. Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991, but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.<P> At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said, \"I believe we can do much better than 20%.\" But she stressed, \"I am against managed trade.

{"prompt":" The Justice Department has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases. A related editorial appears today.<P> Under {RICO}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order -LRB-TRO-RRB- upon the filing of a RICO indictment, in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered. Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants, including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents, and others. Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process. In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions. -LRB-It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office.-RRB-:<P> 1. As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section. The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies -LRB-such as bonds-RRB- are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction.<P> 2.

One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant's reactors. Glenn Cox, Phillips' president and chief operating officer, and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions.<P> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Phillips Petroleum shares fell $1.125 to $23.125.<P> The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel, where about 150 companies have operations, because the thick, black smoke obscured the area. The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo.<P> Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters' efforts, but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control. The blasts blew out windows, spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school. The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston, about 10 miles away.<P> Nearby Pasadena, Texas, police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals, but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise.

The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts. The number working at the time of the blast wasn't known.<P> Yesterday's explosions were the second round in two months at the plastics plant. In late August, four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility's boiler house.<P> The Phillips facility manufactures polyethylene, polypropylene and K-resin, plastics used in a wide array of applications, including milk jugs and toys.

{"prompt":" Eastman Kodak Co., seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market, unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video.<P> The move also helps the Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly, supplying every Hollywood movie company -- isn't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business.<P> While the prototype converter is costly, it's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium.<P> \"The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along,\" says David Niles, president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc., a New York pioneer in high-definition programming. He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs.<P> Japanese electronic giants, such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware, and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition. And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development. It's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing.<P> Kodak says its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video. Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers. Otherwise, they'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs.<P> It would be like \"watching a black and white movie on a color TV set,\" says Malcolm G. Saull, chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology.<P> The new converters are \"a critical link between film and the television domain,\" says Joerg D. Agin, vice president and general manager of Kodak's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division.<P> Kodak won't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market, but it's estimated the machine may be available within two years. A similar machine already on the market, made by Rank Sintel Ltd., a unit of Rank Organisation, costs about $500,000.<P> And the potential market is tremendous, industry experts say. If HDTV takes off in the U.S., there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters, known in the industry as telecines. Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations.<P> \"The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen,\" says Richard J. Stumpf, vice president-engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios. And Mr. Niles, the program producer, contends that Kodak's move is \"a sound marketing decision. They can't afford to stay out of HDTV.\"<P> Indeed, the stakes are high. The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $150 billion over the next two decades, with an additional $400 billion expected to go for related products.<P> HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines, compared with 525 for today's televisions, providing considerably sharper detail. And the sets are wider, resembling the dimensions of a movie screen.<P> But the financial rewards aren't expected soon, nor are they guaranteed. Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs won't be available for another five to 10 years, and will probably retail for more than $3,000 each in today's dollars. Some critics say they won't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price.<P> Nevertheless, Kodak couldn't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur. \"Kodak understands HDTV is where everybody is going,\" says RIT's Mr. Spaull. ->","completion":" ( ( ( ( ( Eastman Kodak Co., ) ( seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market, ) ) ( ( unveiled a converter ) ( that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( The move also helps the Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant ensure ) ( ( ( that its motion-picture film business ) ( ( -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly, ) ( supplying every Hollywood movie company -- ) ) ) ( isn't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business.<P> ) ) ) ( ( While the prototype converter is costly, ) ( ( it's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way ) ( ( of increasing the number of high-quality shows ) ( that can be seen on the new medium.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( \"The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along,\" ) ( says David Niles, president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc., a New York pioneer in high-definition programming. ) ) ( ( He notes ) ( ( that industry executives have until now worried ) ( ( ( ( that they would face a severe shortage of programs ) ( once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs.<P> ) ) ( ( ( Japanese electronic giants, such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware, ) ( and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition. ) ( And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development. ) ) ( It's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Kodak says ) ( ( its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem ) ( ( ( ( by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs ) ( shot in 35mm motion-picture film ) ) ( ( into high-definition video. ) ( ( Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets ) ( ( and get all the viewing benefits ) ( the high-tech medium offers. ) ) ) ) ) ( ( Otherwise, they'd be watching programs ) ( ( that are no different in quality ) ( from what they currently view on color TVs.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( It would be like \"watching a black and white movie on a color TV set,\" ) ( says Malcolm G.

In 1983, Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $150,000 bribe in a case before him, the central charge on which the Senate convicted him. He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial.<P> With no floor debate, the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe, five votes more than needed. Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove Judge Hastings from office. He was found not guilty of three charges, involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive, government investigation. The Senate didn't vote on six lesser charges.<P> Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted by a jury, lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment isn't to punish an individual. Instead, they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust, irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases.<P> Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes, then quickly left the chamber.
