A few months ago, Dentsu acquired 69% of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars -LRB-US$4.6 million-RRB-. Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries, but they keep low profiles.<P> Now, the giant marketing company, which holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen -LRB-$30.96 billion-RRB- advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe. What is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe. \"If we don't do something . . . we won't be able to catch up with demand,\" says a Dentsu spokesman. \"Our president said acquisition is an effective method.\"<P> Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future.

Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice \"that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules,\" says Roy Warman, the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi's communications division.<P> Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the Dentsu spokesman.

{"prompt": " Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations. Now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern, democratic, \"developed nation\" mode of operation.<P> Until 1980, when Japan joined the $10,000 per capita GNP club of the advanced countries, it was a model developing nation. The government built ports, bridges, highways, schools, hospitals and railways. When industries were weak, it protected them. It gave the Japanese people a value system, based on the rationalization that given the country's lack of natural resources, they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus. Individual prosperity inevitably would result.<P> That system has worked. The standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years; more than 90% of the people consider themselves middle class.<P> The people have given their leading and only credible political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years. The LDP won by a landslide in the last election, in July 1986. But less than two years later, the LDP started to crumble, and dissent rose to unprecedented heights.<P> The symptoms all point to one thing: Japan does not have a modern government. Its government still wants to sit in the driver's seat, set the speed, step on the gas, apply the brakes and steer, with 120 million people in the back seat. In a modern system, the government's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice. It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world.<P> The Japanese government doesn't allow this. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions. The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people. The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers, and certainly does not act on behalf of students. The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world, but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic. The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry, certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices.<P> And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself, supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host's. This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan's deteriorating image. Instead, it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries.<P> All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a \"provider\" mentality; they do not serve the people, and particularly not consumers. They serve the industries and the special-interest groups. The rest of the world accepted such methods when Japan was developing. Japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks.<P> Japan is not a political country. It is a bureaucratic country. The Diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system. Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats, not politicians. The Diet doesn't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does that it would be a waste of time. So most bills are passed without full discussion; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties.<P> A recent example is the 3% consumption tax on all commercial activities. This makes enormous sense in Japan, where direct tax accounts for more than 70% of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair. If you are a salaried man, Amen! 100% captured. If you are a retailer, 50%, and a farmer, 30%. To correct this inequality, most people would have favored an indirect tax, like the consumption tax. But the bill was passed without debate in the Diet, in the absence of the opposition. As a result, the Japanese people didn't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on April 1. They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change. All of a sudden, prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200. They were 103 or 206. Pockets exploded with one-yen coins.<P> While people were jingling their change, the LDP politicians were caught in scandals. Money, such as in Recruit's political donations, and women, as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita, seldom have caused political scandals in Japan. Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals -LRB-though they were furious about Recruit-RRB-, women were upset about both and surged to the polls. In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections, in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory, 60% of all women voted, as opposed to the usual 40%. It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to Recruit, the sex scandals, or the one-yen coins in their purses, but they obviously were voting to punish the LDP.<P> Taken by surprise, the Socialist Party is busy changing its doctrines. It's now OK to deal with the U.S., but not the Soviet Union. Nuclear power plants are acceptable. The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty can continue, sort of. And so on.<P> Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party the LDP has been paralyzed. Now is the time to reform the government from a provider, developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern, industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice. If the LDP, as currently composed, can't make the transformation, then it should split into two parties. One party could stand for consumer interests, small government, free trade and globalism to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open countries. The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP, representing the manufacturers' preference for larger government, control, regulation and protectionism.<P> The LDP must make a decision immediately; Lower House elections must take place before June. In the current mood of the Japanese people, journalists and even some industrialists, giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP, cleansing it of past sins.

{"prompt": " When last we left him, FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery, unraveled a Washington political scandal, and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries \"Favorite Son.\" What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold? A spinoff series, of course.<P> There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup: a nun raising some lovable orphans. A den mother raising some lovable teen models. A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards.<P> In that context, Robert Loggia's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most. Week by week on \"Mancuso FBI\" -LRB-NBC, Fridays, 10 p.m. ET-RRB-, he pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI.<P> Over the first few weeks, \"Mancuso FBI\" has sprung straight from the headlines, which is either a commendable stab at topicality, or a lack of imagination, or both. The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing -LRB-a la John Tower-RRB-. When his secretary is found floating dead in the pol's pool, Mancuso is called in to investigate.<P> Last week, a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer -LRB-a la Tawana Brawley-RRB-. In this week's show, there's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility -LRB-a la Rocky Flats-RRB-.<P> Along the way, we're introduced to the supporting cast: a blond bombshell secretary -LRB-Randi Brazen -- her real name, honest-RRB-, a scheming young boss -LRB-Fredric Lehne-RRB-, another blonde bombshell who's also an idealistic lawyer -LRB-Lindsay Frost-RRB-, and a forensics expert -LRB-Charles Siebert-RRB-.<P> If all of this seems a little stale, it's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists: The usual suspects are found to be guilty, then not guilty, then guilty -- but of a different crime. -LRB-In last week's rape case, for example, the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest, and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case.-RRB- Most of all though, the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso.<P> What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned, we discover, when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s. He wasn't protecting the Freedom Marchers; he was tailing them as subversives. This is not the \"Mississippi Burning\" scenario that thrills his young colleagues: \"Kid, you've been reading Classic Comics too long,\" Mancuso says. \"Back in 1964, the FBI had five black agents. Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover, and two cleaned his house.\"<P> At the core of Mr. Loggia's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence. He describes a reporter as \"Miss First Amendment.\" He describes a drowned corpse as \"Esther Williams.\" And when he's told \"Try a little tenderness,\" he shoots back \"I'm going home to try a little linguine.\"<P> Yet for all his cynicism, he's at heart a closet idealist, a softy with a secret crush on truth, justice and the American Way. He's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags.<P> If \"Mancuso FBI\" has an intriguing central character, it also has a major flaw: It's wildly overwritten. Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner -LRB-and writer/producers Ken Solarz and Steve Bello-RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point.<P> To start, there's always a crisis -- and someone always worries, \"What if the press gets a hold of this?\" At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans. At least once Mancuso's boss yells \"In here -- now,\" and proceeds to dress his investigator down: \"You are a dinosaur . . . a hangover in a $10 suit . . . One more word and you are out on a park bench, mister.\" Finally, of course, the boss gives in, but he's still yelling: \"I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy, you'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage.\"<P> In fact, throughout \"Mancuso FBI,\" we don't get words or lines -- we get speeches. Witnesses shout, scream, pontificate: \". . . a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice.\"<P> And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs: \"How the hell can you live with yourself?\" he erupts at a politician. \"You twist people's trust. You built your career on prejudice and hate. The scars will be here years after the polls close.\"<P> In each show, Mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues: \"Where the hell are they gonna live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump? You're the real criminal here . . . and what you did wasn't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity.\"<P> And, at least once a show, someone delivers the line \"Get off that soapbox.\" Now that's advice the writers should take to heart. They have a series with a good character, some interesting, even occasionally surprising plot lines, and they're ruining it.<P> Why, when a key witness disappears, does Mancuso trash her apartment, tearing down drapes, smashing walls? It's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction, all to add more pizzazz to a script that's already overdosing on pizzazz. That's not plot. That's not character. That's hyperventilating.<P> There is a scene at the end of the first week's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David. Asked to say a few words, he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk, but he's too choked up to get the words out. He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration, then turns and walks away. It was a profoundly moving moment for series television, and Robert Loggia's acting resonated in the silence.<P> There's a pretty good program inside all the noise of \"Mancuso FBI.\" If the show's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little, they might just hear it. ->", "completion": " ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( When last we left him, ) ( ( FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery, ) ( unraveled a Washington political scandal, ) ( and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries \"Favorite Son.\" ) ) ) ( ( What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold? ) ( A spinoff series, of course.<P> ) ) ) ( ( There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows ) ( ( -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup: ) ( ( ( ( a nun ) ( raising some lovable orphans. ) ) ( ( A den mother ) ( raising some lovable teen models. ) ) ( ( A bunch of tans and bathing suits ) ( posing as lovable lifeguards.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( In that context, Robert Loggia's riveting performance as the unlovable ) ( -- even crotchety -- ) ) ( veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most. ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Week by week on \"Mancuso FBI\" ) ( -LRB-NBC, Fridays, 10 p.m. ET-RRB-, ) ) ( ( he pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the Washington scene ) ( -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( Over the first few weeks, \"Mancuso FBI\" has sprung straight from the headlines, ) ( which is either a commendable stab at topicality, or a lack of imagination, or both. ) ) ( ( ( ( ( The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate ) ( accused of womanizing ) ) ( -LRB-a la John Tower-RRB-. ) ) ( ( When his secretary is found floating dead in the pol's pool, ) ( Mancuso is called in to investigate.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( Last week, a young black girl claimed ) ( she had been raped by a white police officer ) ) ( -LRB-a la Tawana Brawley-RRB-. ) ) ( ( In this week's show, there's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility ) ( -LRB-a la Rocky Flats-RRB-.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( Along the way, we're introduced to the supporting cast: ) ( ( ( a blond bombshell secretary ) ( ( -LRB-Randi Brazen ) ( -- her real name, honest-RRB-, ) ) ) ( ( a scheming young boss ) ( -LRB-Fredric Lehne-RRB-, ) ) ( ( ( another blonde bombshell ) ( who's also an idealistic lawyer ) ) ( -LRB-Lindsay Frost-RRB-, ) ) ( ( and a forensics expert ) ( -LRB-Charles Siebert-RRB-.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( If all of this seems a little stale, ) ( it's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists: ) ) ( ( ( The usual suspects are found to be guilty, then not guilty, then guilty ) ( -- but of a different crime. ) ) ( ( -LRB-In last week's rape case, for example, the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest, ) ( ( and the biggest villains are the politicians ) ( who exploit the case.-RRB- ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( Most of all though, the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso.<P> ) ( ( ( ( ( What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism ) ( ( ( -- earned, ) ( we discover, ) ) ( when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s. ) ) ) ( ( He wasn't protecting the Freedom Marchers; ) ( he was tailing them as subversives. ) ) ) ( ( ( ( This is not the \"Mississippi Burning\" scenario ) ( that thrills his young colleagues: ) ) ( ( ( \"Kid, you've been reading Classic Comics too long,\" ) ( Mancuso says. ) ) ( ( \"Back in 1964, the FBI had five black agents. ) ( ( Three were chauffeurs for J.

{"prompt": " Time magazine, in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers, is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year, increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways.<P> In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will \"dramatically de-emphasize\" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 to $55.<P> In a related development, the news-weekly, for the fourth year in a row, said it won't increase its advertising rates in 1990; a full, four-color page in the magazine costs about $120,000. However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered, ad rates will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber, according to Richard Heinemann, Time associate publisher.<P> Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers. In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co. 's McCall's, and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers.<P> Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies. But Time, as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner, wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks. Besides, Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky. \"Giveaways just give people the wrong image,\" said Mr. Heinemann. \"That perception takes the focus off the magazine.\"<P> Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers. \"What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it,\" said Mr. Heinemann. \"We are trying to create quality and involvement.\"<P> However, Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million. And Time's paid circulation, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations, dropped 7.3% to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30, 1989.<P> Still, Time's move is being received well, once again. \"It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more,\" said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency. \"A few drops in circulation are of no consequence. It's not a show of weakness; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits.\"<P> Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away. \"The question is how much are we getting from each reader,\" said Mr. Heinemann.<P> Time's rivals news-weeklies, Washington Post Co.

{"prompt": " Exxon Corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped 9% as profits from two of its three major businesses sagged. All cleanup costs from last spring's Alaskan oil spill were reflected in earlier results, it said.<P> Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. also reported declines in quarterly profit, while Ashland Oil Inc. posted a loss for the latest quarter. Amerada Hess Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported higher earnings.<P> Exxon<P> Although Exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the Alaskan shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill, those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by $880 million in charges taken during the first half.<P> An Exxon official said that at this time the oil company doesn't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil spilled when one of its tankers rammed into an underwater reef. She added, however, that charges already taken don't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill. She said that impact can't be reasonably assessed yet.<P> Exxon's net income during the third quarter dropped to $1.11 billion, or 87 cents a share, from $1.22 billion, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8.1%, to $23.65 billion from $21.88 billion. During the third quarter, Exxon purchased 8.34 million shares of its stock at a cost of $373 million. Exxon's profitability, like that of many other oil companies, was hurt during the third quarter by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing businesses. Exxon's earnings from chemicals operations fell $90 million, to $254 million, while refining and marketing profits declined $180 million, to $357 million.<P> Although crude oil prices were significantly higher this year, they weren't strong enough to offset the declining profits in those business sectors at most oil companies, said William Randol, oil analyst for First Boston Corp. He estimates that the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was $4.04 a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year.<P> Ashland Oil<P> A rash of one-time charges left Ashland Oil with a loss of $39 million for its fiscal fourth quarter. A year earlier, the refiner earned $66 million, or $1.19 a share. Quarterly revenue rose 4.5%, to $2.3 billion from $2.2 billion. For the year, net income tumbled 61% to $86 million, or $1.55 a share.<P> The Ashland, Ky., oil company reported a $38 million charge resulting from settlement of a 10-year dispute with the National Iranian Oil Co. over claims that Ashland didn't pay for Iranian crude it had received. In September, Ashland settled the long-simmering dispute by agreeing to pay Iran $325 million.<P> Ashland also took a $25 million after-tax charge to cover anticipated costs to correct problems with boilers built by one of its subsidiaries. The oil refiner also booked a $15 million charge for selling Ashland Technology Corp., one of its subsidiaries, at a loss.<P> Amerada Hess<P> Third-quarter earnings at Amerada Hess more than tripled to $51.81 million, or 64 cents a share, from $15.7 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 28%, to $1.18 billion from $925 million.<P> Profits improved across Hess's businesses. Refining and marketing earnings climbed to $33.3 million from $12.9 million, and exploration and production earnings rose to $37.1 million from $17.9 million. Hess's earnings were up despite a $30 million charge to cover the cost of maintaining operations after Hurricane Hugo heavily damaged the company's refinery at St. Croix. It is widely known within industry circles that Hess had to buy oil products in the high-priced spot markets to continue supplying its customers. Hess declined to comment.<P> Phillips Petroleum<P> Phillips Petroleum's third-quarter earnings slid 60%, to $87 million, or 36 cents a share, from $215 million, or 89 cents a share. Revenue rose 6.9%, to $3.1 billion from $2.9 billion. Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline, said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement. Despite higher oil prices, exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of Phillips' North Sea oil fields. A year ago, results were buoyed by a $20 million after-tax gain from an asset sale.<P> Occidental Petroleum<P> Occidental Petroleum's third-quarter net income rose 2.9% to $108 million, or 39 cents a share, from $105 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $71 million from non-recurring items. Sales dropped 2%, to $4.8 billion from $4.9 billion. The latest period included a $54 million gain from the sale of various oil and gas properties, a $22 million charge from the restructuring of Occidental's domestic oil and gas operations, and tax credits of $42 million. Both periods included non-recurring charges of $3 million for early retirement of debt.<P> Occidental said oil and gas earnings fell to $17 million from $20 million. The latest period includes net gains of $32 million in non-recurring credits from the sale of properties, indicating operating losses for the quarter in the oil and gas division. Chemical earnings fell 10%, reflecting softening of demand.<P> Atlantic Richfield<P> Citing its reduced ownership in the Lyondell Petrochemical Co., Atlantic Richfield reported that net income slid 3.1% in the third quarter to $379 million, or $2.19 a share, from $391 million, or $2.17 a share, for the comparable period last year. Sales fell 20%, to $3.7 billion from $4.6 billion.<P> Arco's earnings from its 49.9% stake in Lyondell fell to $37 million from $156 million for the same period last year, when Lyondell was wholly owned. Offsetting the lower stake in Lyondell were higher crude oil prices, increased natural gas volumes and higher coke prices, the company said. Coal earnings rose to $26 million from $21 million.<P> For the nine months, Arco reported net income of $1.6 billion, or $8.87 a share, up 33% from $1.2 billion, or $6.56 a share a year earlier.

{"prompt": " Chip's Memory Is Here Today, Here Tomorrow<P> TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off.<P> Today's most widely used data-storing chips have \"volatile\" memories -- their data disappear if they aren't fed a steady diet of electricity, so they need external power supplies.<P> National Semiconductor Corp. and a start-up named Ramtron Corp. plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories, which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them. The chips use materials, such as lead zirconate titanate, to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity.<P> Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology isn't fully refined. But Ramtron of Colorado Springs, Colo., plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December. The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment, including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives.<P> National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque, N.M. National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips, including a 4-kilobit memory, next year.<P> Once production hurdles are overcome, the chips could take over a significant part of the market. In addition to not needing an outside power source, they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips.<P> Military buyers have shown interest, National says, because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation. And while today's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- can't be used in a computer's central memory because they \"learn\" data slowly, ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds.<P> Showing Up in Court<P> Without Being There<P> AN AUSTIN, Texas, company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town.<P> Witnesses often must travel long distances to give face-to-face depositions before lawyers and court reporters. That means huge travel bills. And telephone or videotape depositions just don't match physical encounters.<P> That could change, thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics. Video Telecom Corp., which markets videoconferencing systems, is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television.<P> The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines. And it is preparing to set up shop in Chicago, New York and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network.<P> While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before, the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper.<P> An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $200 and $400, depending on the quality of the picture, to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities.<P> Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection<P> JAPAN'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers. Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables.<P> Until now, most Japanese charges have been responses to suits against them. But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan's electronics industry when it accused Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips. -LRB-A settlement was reached but wasn't made public.-RRB- And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S.'s Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that Motorola's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent.<P> Another recent Hitachi suit accuses Motorola of reverse engineering a Hitachi technology -- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers.<P> The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say Japan is starting to take.<P> Hitachi made the reverse-engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district court in Texas after Motorola sued Hitachi for patent violation. Hitachi charges Motorola \"has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents\" used in Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor chip.<P> Translation: Motorola appears to have taken a Hitachi technology that is patented in the U.S., Hitachi says, and \"tried to make it look like a new technology.\"<P> Motorola either denied or wouldn't comment on the various charges.<P> Odds and Ends<P> COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by Japan's Sharp Corp. They mimic the brain by \"looking\" at an image, extracting the fundamentals -- boundaries, corners and lines -- and translating them into computer data. Sharp says the set of chips could improve fax machines, graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features. . . . An N.V. Philips unit has created a computer system that processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems.

{"prompt": " Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc., a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players.<P> Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts, by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime, cable-TV industry executives say. Time officials declined to comment.<P> Last week, Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $225 million for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary, which is a distant second to Time's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers. Tele-Communications, the U.S.'s largest cable company, said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment.<P> Tele-Communications is HBO's largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships. Earlier this year, Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO, executives at both companies said. The purchase of the Showtime stake is \"a direct slap in our face,\" said one senior Time executive.<P> Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York, where Viacom in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime. Executives involved in plotting Time's defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants. The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated, or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime.<P> Viacom officials declined to comment. Jerome Kern, Tele-Communications' chief outside counsel, said he wasn't aware of Time's legal plans. But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be \"the pot calling the kettle black.\"<P> \"It's hard to see how an investment by the largest {cable operator} in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive, when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest\" cable operator, Mr. Kern said.<P> In addition to owning HBO, with 22 million subscribers, Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers. Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and Viacom has about one million. In its suit against Time, Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power. Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications, Viacom has potentially more power, particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV, VH-1 and Nick at Nite. Ironically, Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business. Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele-Communications has a 21.8% stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake. But since Time's merger with Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained. Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated.<P> Meanwhile, some legal observers say the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom's antitrust suit against Time. Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on Time's Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems.

{"prompt": " Population Drain Ends For Midwestern States<P> IOWA IS MAKING a comeback. So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s.<P> The gains, to be sure, are rather small. Iowa, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or 0.4%, between 1987 and 1988, the Census Bureau says. Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that hadn't grown at all since 1981.<P> Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people. Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin.<P> The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race. Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980, including New York, which lost 4% of its population during the 1970s. And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again.<P> At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround. Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming and Alaska.<P> Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest, and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue. But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing.<P> More Elderly Maintain Their Independence<P> THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together. And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent. A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64% of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970.<P> This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however. That share has remained at about 24% since 1970. What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children. In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970.<P> As people get even older, many become widowed. But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to 40% in 1988 from 38% in 1970.<P> Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives. Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970.<P> The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40% from 32%.

Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families. Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group.<P> Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich. Average household income for the sample was $194,000, and average net assets were reported as $775,000.<P> The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class.

Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off.<P> Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either. About 40% don't feel they're more able than others. While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent, only 25% give $2,500 or more to charity each year.<P> Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, 60% feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one's principles.<P> Odds and Ends<P> THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978.

{"prompt": " If bluebloods won't pay high prices for racehorses anymore, who will?<P> Breeders are betting on the common folk.<P> The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, a Lexington, Ky.-based trade group, has launched \"seminars\" for \"potential investors\" at race tracks around the country. The group, which has held half a dozen seminars so far, also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers.<P> \"People in this business have been insulated,\" says Josh Pons, a horse breeder from Bel Air, Md. \"But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses.\"<P> At the Laurel race track, the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings, a beer packaging plant worker. Right now, Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program, cheering for Karnak on the Nile, a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch.<P> Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13, and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm. \"Just imagine how exciting that would be if that's your horse,\" he says.<P> But experts caution that this isn't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet. \"It's a big-risk business,\" warns Charles C. Mihalek, a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner. \"You have to go into it firmly believing that it's the kind of investment where you can lose everything.\"<P> And many have done just that. Consider Spendthrift Farm, a prominent Lexington horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year. A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift, hoping to rebuild it.<P> Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights. One big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market. From 1974 to 1984, prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918% to an average of $544,681. Since then, prices have slumped, to an average of $395,374 this summer. But that's for the best horses, with most selling for much less -- as little as $100 for some pedestrian thoroughbreds. Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle, racehorse owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport. Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner's circle and high-society schmoozing. One handout promises: \"Pedigrees, parties, post times, parimutuels and pageantry.\"<P> \"It's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves,\" says Headley Bell, a fifth-generation horse breeder from Lexington.<P> Maybe it's not that simple. For starters, racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures: These beasts don't come with warranties. And for every champion, there are plenty of nags. Katherine Voss, a veteran trainer at the Laurel, Md., track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses.<P> One brown two-year-old filly was wheezing from a cold, while another had splints on its legs, keeping both animals from the racetrack. \"You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof,\" she tells the group. \"There aren't too many winners.\"<P> Perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business.
