{"prompt":" General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of Jaguar PLC, as GM got early clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to boost its stake in the British luxury car maker.<P> GM confirmed Friday that it received permission late Thursday from U.S. antitrust regulators to increase its Jaguar holdings past the $15 million level. Ford got a similar go-ahead earlier in October, and on Friday, Jaguar announced that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker had raised its stake to 13.2%, or 24.2 million shares, from 12.4% earlier in the week.<P> A spokesman for GM, the No. 1 auto maker, declined to say how many Jaguar shares that company owns. In late trading Friday, Jaguar shares bucked the downward tide in London's stock market and rose five pence to 725 pence -LRB-$11.44-RRB-. Trading volume was a moderately heavy 3.1 million shares. In the U.S., Jaguar's American depositary receipts were among the most active issues Friday in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $11.625 each, up 62.5 cents.<P> Analysts expect that the two U.S. auto giants will move quickly to buy up 15% stakes in Jaguar, setting up a potential bidding war for the prestigious Jaguar brand.<P> British government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15% before the end of 1990 without government permission. The British government, which owned Jaguar until 1984, still holds a controlling \"golden share\" in the company.<P> With the golden share as protection, Jaguar officials have rebuffed Ford's overtures, and moved instead to forge an alliance with GM. Jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with GM that would preserve Jaguar's independence, but no deal has been announced. Ford, on the other hand, has said it's willing to bid for all of Jaguar, despite the objections of Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan. Analysts continued to speculate late last week that Ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder's meeting and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990.

{"prompt":" Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two \"world-class\" hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow.<P> U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations. \"This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress,\" said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture's partners at the Soviet embassy here.<P> Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who attended the ceremony, called the undertaking a \"historic step\" in the evolution of U.S.-Soviet ties. He added that it likely will have a \"mulitiplier effect\" in stimulating further trade between the two countries.<P> The project will be the largest U.S.-backed joint venture to be undertaken in the Soviet Union in recent years. One of the hotels, to be called the Sheraton Moscow, will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $75 million to build. The six-story hotel will be on Gorky Street and initially will cater mostly to business travelers. It will have a Russian tavern, an English pub, a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants, according to a Sheraton announcement. The hotel is scheduled to open in 1992.<P> The second hotel, to be called the Budapest Hotel, is to be constructed at a site even closer to Red Square. Details about its size and cost haven't yet been determined.<P> Sheraton, a subsidiary of ITT Corp., will have a 40% share in the two hotels; Pan American, a subsidiary of Pan Am Corp., will have a 10% share. The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet, Moscow's city governing body, and Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline.<P> Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel, the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union to have as much as 50% foreign ownership.<P> U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987. But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched. Chevron Corp., Amoco Corp., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures.<P> Sheraton and Pan Am said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture. The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $140 to $150 a day for each of its rooms, and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets, according to a Sheraton executive.<P> Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said the U.S. airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights. He said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard Moscow hotels. ->","completion":" ( ( ( Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced ) ( that they and two Soviet partners will construct two \"world-class\" hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow.<P> ) ) ( ( U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations. ) ( ( ( ( \"This is an outstanding example ) ( of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress,\" ) ) ( ( said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, ) ( who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture's partners at the Soviet embassy here.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, ) ( who attended the ceremony, ) ) ( called the undertaking a \"historic step\" in the evolution of U.S.-Soviet ties. ) ) ( ( He added ) ( ( that it likely will have a \"mulitiplier effect\" ) ( in stimulating further trade between the two countries.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( The project will be the largest U.S.-backed joint venture ) ( to be undertaken in the Soviet Union in recent years. ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ( One of the hotels, ) ( to be called the Sheraton Moscow, ) ) ( ( will have 450 rooms ) ( ( and will cost an estimated $75 million ) ( to build. ) ) ) ) ( ( The six-story hotel will be on Gorky Street ) ( and initially will cater mostly to business travelers. ) ( ( It will have a Russian tavern, an English pub, a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants, ) ( according to a Sheraton announcement. ) ) ( The hotel is scheduled to open in 1992.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( ( The second hotel, ) ( to be called the Budapest Hotel, ) ) ( is to be constructed at a site even closer to Red Square. ) ) ( Details about its size and cost haven't yet been determined.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( Sheraton, a subsidiary of ITT Corp., will have a 40% share in the two hotels; ) ( Pan American, a subsidiary of Pan Am Corp., will have a 10% share. ) ) ( The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet, Moscow's city governing body, and Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline.<P> ) ( ( Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel, ) ( ( the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union ) ( to have as much as 50% foreign ownership.<P> ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures ) ( ( that have been announced ) ( since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987. ) ) ) ( ( ( But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects ) ( ( that could be among the biggest ones ) ( to be launched. ) ) ) ( ( ( Chevron Corp., Amoco Corp., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies ) ( known to be considering such ventures.<P> ) ) ( ( ( ( Sheraton and Pan Am said ) ( ( they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law ) ( that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture. ) ) ) ( ( ( The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $140 to $150 a day for each of its rooms, ) ( ( and it will accept payment only in currencies ) ( that can be traded in foreign exchange markets, ) ) ) ( according to a Sheraton executive.<P> ) ) ) ( ( ( Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said ) ( ( the U.S. airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot ) ( to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights. ) ) ) ( ( He said ) ( the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard Moscow hotels. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )\n"}

{"prompt":" Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites, the Office of Thrift Supervision said.<P> But that doesn't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks, the agency said. The office, an arm of the Treasury, said it doesn't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus can't determine why blacks are rejected more often.<P> Nevertheless, on Capitol Hill, where the information was released yesterday at a Senate banking subcommittee hearing, lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities. They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws.<P> Sen. Alan Dixon -LRB-D, Ill.-RRB-, chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said, \"I'm not a statistician. But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites -- and in some cities, it is three and four times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem.\"<P> James Grohl, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said, \"The data is a red flag, but lacking the financial data you can't make a case that discrimination is widespread.\" The trade group official added: \"Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it.\"<P> Sen. Dixon held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending. The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race, sex and income level of borrowers, but that information won't be gathered in new studies for several months at least.<P> The Federal Reserve said its studies in recent years, which adjust for income differences and other variables, showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites. But John LaWare, a Fed governor, told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed's believes the vast majority of banks aren't discriminating. For instance, he noted, the Fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites.<P> Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination. \"We would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years\" to developing examinations for discrimination, said Jonathan Fiechter, a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision.<P> \"If we've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly,\" said Sen. Donald Riegle -LRB-D., Mich.-RRB-, chairman of the banking committee, \"then that is a matter that needs remedy now, not six months from now, or six years from now, or 26 years from now.\"<P> Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws. The FDIC said it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices.<P> The comptroller's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987. The comptroller's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987, only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending.
